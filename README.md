> quick mockup rewrite in vuejs

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).


## Dependencies
Are all in the package.json. However, jQuery UI is not yet webpack-ready (only in beta). Until they release, copy the [beta jqueryUI](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2016/04/jquery-ui-1-12-0-release-candidate-2/) to the `src/libs/jquery-ui.js`.
